# MongoDB - The M in MERN!

MongoDB is a document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL (not only SQL) database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. They're BSON file types.

NoSQL databases provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

## When should NoSQL be used?

When deciding which database to use, decision-makers typically find one or more of the following factors lead them to selecting a NoSQL database:

- Fast-paced development
- Storage of structured and semi-structured data
- Huge volumes of data

## Misconception: relationship data is best suited for relational databases

A common misconception is that NoSQL databases or non-relational databases don’t store relationship data well. NoSQL databases can store relationship data — they just store it differently than relational databases do.

In fact, when compared with relational databases, many find modeling relationship data in NoSQL databases to be easier than in relational databases, because related data doesn’t have to be split between tables. NoSQL data models allow related data to be nested within a single data structure.
