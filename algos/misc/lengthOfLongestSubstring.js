/* 
  Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
*/

const str1 = "abcabcbb";
const expected1 = 3;
// Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

const str2 = "bbbbb";
const expected2 = 1;
// Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

const str3 = "pwwkew";
const expected3 = 3;
/* Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
  Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring. */
