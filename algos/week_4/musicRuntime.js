/* 
Amazon is developing a new song selection algorithm that will sync with the
duration of your bus ride.
Given a positive integer representing a duration of a bus ride and
an array of positive integers representing song times, find a pair of two songs
where the song pair ends 30 seconds before the bus ride ends.
return an array of the song indexes or [-1, -1] if no pair is found.
If there are multiple song pairs that match, return the pair that contains the
longest song. The order of the returned indexes doesn't matter.

There are multiple pairs that add up to 30 seconds before the bus duration.
