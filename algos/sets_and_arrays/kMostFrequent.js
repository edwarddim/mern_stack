  Given an unsorted non-empty array of integers and int k, return the k most frequent elements (in any order)
  You can assume there is always a valid solution
  These example inputs are sorted for readability, but the input is NOT guaranteed to be sorted and the output does NOT need to be 
  in any specific order
  Hard Bonus: make it O(n) time
